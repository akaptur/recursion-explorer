This program is intended to be used as a learning tool for programmers practicing recursion.

Given a recursive function, the program will show the path taken through the code.  
Each line of code that executes is written into the output file.  Lines that do not 
execute (e.g. the code blocks below conditionals that evaluate to false) are not shown. 
The code gets indented every time the function is called (i.e. every time the program 
steps deeper into the recursion).
